My first tweak i ever wrote :)

# Features

- Make App instalation Progress bard lighter
- Set Status Bar to ï£¿ (Apple Logo you can't see on Windows/Linux)
- Configure Tweak in settings

# To-Do
- Add More featuresTM

# Depends
- This [SDK](https://github.com/CrafterPika/Clutty/blob/master/deps/iPhoneOS_13.1_Build_SDK.zip?raw=true) (for building the tweak)
  - place the extracted <code>iPhoneOS13.1.sdk</code> in <code>/var/mobile/theos/sdks/</code>
- You need <code>Theos</code> on your Mac/iOS (iOS User can use <code>Theos Installer 2 (unc0ver and checkra1n)</code>, it's on <a href="cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://jakeashacks.net/cydia/">JakeaHacks Repo</a>)

# Compiling
I use theos on my iDevice to do this. just type <code>make package</code> if you are using theos too.
